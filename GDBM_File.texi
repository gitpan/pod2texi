@unnumberedsec DESCRIPTION

@strong{GDBM_File} is a module which allows Perl programs to make use of the
facilities provided by the GNU gdbm library.  If you intend to use this
module you should really have a copy of the gdbm manualpage at hand.

Most of the libgdbm.a functions are available through the GDBM_File
interface.

@unnumberedsec AVAILABILITY

Gdbm is available from any GNU archive.  The master site is
@code{prep.ai.mit.edu}, but your are strongly urged to use one of the many
mirrors.   You can obtain a list of mirror sites by issuing the
command	@code{finger fsf@@prep.ai.mit.edu}.

@unnumberedsec BUGS

The available functions and the gdbm/perl interface need to be documented.
