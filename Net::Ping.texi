@unnumberedsec NAME

Net::Ping, pingecho - check a host for upness

@unnumberedsec SYNOPSIS

@example
use Net::Ping;
print "@'jimmy@' is alive and kicking\n" if pingecho(@'jimmy@', 10) ;
@end example

@unnumberedsec DESCRIPTION

This module contains routines to test for the reachability of remote hosts.
Currently the only routine implemented is pingecho(). 

pingecho() uses a TCP echo (@emph{not} an ICMP one) to determine if the
remote host is reachable. This is usually adequate to tell that a remote
host is available to rsh(1), ftp(1), or telnet(1) onto.

@unnumberedsubsec Parameters

@table @asis
@item hostname
The remote host to check, specified either as a hostname or as an IP address.

@item timeout
The timeout in seconds. If not specified it will default to 5 seconds.

@end table
@unnumberedsec WARNING

pingecho() uses alarm to implement the timeout, so don@'t set another alarm
while you are using it.
