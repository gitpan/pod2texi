@unnumberedsec NAME

SyslogScan::WhereIs::guess -- return full path of syslog file where
mail messages are logged

@unnumberedsec SYNOPSIS

@example
my $syslogPath =
    new SyslogScan::Whereis::guess("/etc/syslog.conf");
@end example

@unnumberedsec DESCRIPTION

Scans a syslog configuration file to try to figure out where
"mail.info" messages are sent.  Default configuration file is
"/etc/syslog.conf".

Returns undef if the syslog file cannot be determined.

@unnumberedsec BUGS

It might have been more elegant to return an array of syslog files;
this would, as a bonus, permit multiple syslogs to be returned if mail
messages go to more than one place.
