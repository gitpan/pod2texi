@unnumbered warn of errors (from perspective of caller)


@unnumberedsec NAME

carp - warn of errors (from perspective of caller)

croak - die of errors (from perspective of caller)

confess - die of errors with stack backtrace

@unnumberedsec SYNOPSIS

@example
use Carp;
croak "We@'re outta here!";
@end example

@unnumberedsec DESCRIPTION

The Carp routines are useful in your own modules because
they act like die() or warn(), but report where the error
was in the code they were called from.  Thus if you have a 
routine Foo() that has a carp() in it, then the carp() 
will report the error as occurring where Foo() was called, 
not where carp() was called.
