@unnumberedsec NAME

Filter::sh - sh source filter

@unnumberedsec SYNOPSIS

@example
use Filter::sh @'command@' ;
@end example

@unnumberedsec DESCRIPTION

This filter pipes the current source file through the program which
corresponds to the command parameter using the Bourne shell. 

As with all source filters its scope is limited to the current source
file only. Every file you want to be processed by the filter must have a

@example
use Filter::sh @'command@' ;
@end example

near the top.

Here is an example script which uses the filter:

@example
use Filter::sh @'tr XYZ PQR@' ;
$a = 1 ;
print "XYZ a = $a\n" ;
@end example

And here is what it will output:

@example
PQR = 1
@end example

@unnumberedsec WARNING

You should be @emph{very} careful when using this filter. Because of the
way the filter is implemented it is possible to end up with deadlock.

Be especially careful when stacking multiple instances of the filter in
a single source file.
